### Laravel Starter App

This is a simple starter app for Laravel 5.1 incorporating Vue.js, JWT Tokens, Dingo API, and CORS. Front end packages
include Bootstrap SASS, Select2 (with Bootstrap theme), and FontAwesome.

To install: Clone this repo (https://github.com/dojorob76/laravel-restful-starter-app.git) into your project
directory, then run 'composer install', 'npm install', 'bower install', and 'gulp'. Note: Composer and NPM must
already be installed in your environment. Gulp and Bower must be installed (via NPM) before running them as well.

A boilerplate Vue file and app.blade.php file are included for convenience.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
